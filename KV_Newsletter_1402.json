	"Pstw24": "Your baby's communication skills are getting better every day and soon they'll realise that when you say their name you're referring to them. You may find they babble a fair bit at this age, but be patient it takes a while for baby's brain to associate 'ma-ma' and 'da-da' to their real meaning.",
	"Pstw25": "Your baby loves to grab at things, anything! But it's impossible to know yet if your little one will be a righty or a lefty - regardless of which hand they seem to grab things with now. You won't know for sure until they're two or three years old.",
	"Pstw26": "It's all about movement at 26 weeks, so you need to keep an eye on them all the time! It's a good idea when they're exploring to keep them in loose clothing that doesn't inhibit their ability to move.",
	"Pstw22": "Building a tower of blocks and knocking it down is sure-fire entertainment these days - and dropping things continuously, as your baby is fascinated by the sound of the object hitting the ground.",
	"Pstw27": "Now your little one is moving on to solids don't be surprised if their poos reflect the colour of food you've given them. Nappies can become explosive too!",
	"Pstw28": "Your baby's fine motor skills (using fingers or thumbs to help pick things up) will develop quicker than gross motor skills (like learning to crawl). Putting a toy a little out of reach of your baby can encourage them to move towards it.",
	"Pstw29": "The days of leaving baby on the floor playing and them being in the same spot a few minutes later will be coming to an end.",
	"Pstw23": "Your baby's getting better at spotting smaller objects and tracking moving things. A preference for bright, primary colours is developing too so it's a great time to explore picture books and toys more complicated designs.",
	"Pstw30": "Your baby is starting to understand that objects have different shapes and sizes and may enjoy stacking blocks (or knocking them down after you stack them). Introduce toys that have pieces that fit into each other like shape sorters and wooden puzzles.",
	"Pstw31": "Your little one may have mastered the art of crawling and be busy exploring the world around them. Don't panic if your baby isn't there yet. Some babies skip the crawling phase altogether and others start with a commando crawl.",
	"Pstw32": "Learning to let go, your baby is probably having great fun dropping things for you to pick up... not so much fun for you!",
	"Pstw33": "You may notice that your baby cries if you leave the room or gets very upset if left with someone else other than you. Separation anxiety is common and at some point happens to many little ones.",
	"Pstw34": "Your baby will be showing signs of their own little personality but are their traits down to whether they're a boy or a girl?",
	"Pstw35": "Every parent wants their baby to grow up happy, but how do we really know if they are happy and content?",
	"Pstw36": "Making sounds that mimic words may be more common now and even standing with the help of the furniture.",
	"Pstw37": "Tummy time is important throughout your baby's first year and not just the early months. Find out the benefits of tummy time for your baby's development throughout your baby's first year.",
	"Pstw01": "Congratulations! Your little one has arrived and we hope you're enjoying every minute. Your small and precious newborn baby might look a little squashed and wrinkly but this is normal right now - we would too if we were squished up inside for 9 months!",
	"Pstw02": "It probably feels like your baby's been in your lives forever. They'll have changed so much already and possibly sleeping up to 18 hours a day. But you may have had a rude welcome to the wonderful world of sleep deprivation. We know it's rough and we feel for you, is all we can offer right now.",
	"Pstw03": "It's perfectly normal to feel on top of the world one moment then overwhelmed the next. Your body has been through a lot, your hormones are all over the place and it's been a while since you slept well. Take each day as it comes.",
	"Pstw04": "Your baby may find their hands and feet this week and accidentally hit themselves a few times! And you may find yourself pulling some of the silliest faces to get them to smile!",
	"Pstw05": "Your cuddling, singing and conversation make your baby's world. Your baby knows your voice, your smell and your appearance. Keep making funny faces. You might soon start to hear little 'ooh' and 'aah' sounds which will make your heart melt!",
	"Pstw06": "Your baby will be smiling at around six weeks (it isn't just wind anymore!) and you'll be enjoying tons of their adorable new facial expressions. If you hold your little one over your shoulder, they may also be able to hold their head up for a couple of seconds.",
	"Pstw17": "Your baby is really beginning to grasp communicating and will have great fun chatting to you - listen for lots of da-das, ga-gas, and have fun blowing raspberries.",
	"Pstw18": "Your baby's hands and feet are a huge source of fun now, and they are probably putting anything and everything into their mouths. Learning all about different textures and fascinated by the sights and sounds around.",
	"Pstw19": "Right now your human interaction is feeding your baby's social and verbal development daily. Keep reading too as studies have shown  that children who were read to as babies have a larger vocabulary.",
	"Pstw20": "You're probably noticing your baby starting to show more control of their head and neck muscles. Your baby may also be bringing their hands together so enjoy practising pat-a-cake.",
	"Pstw21": "You may have noticed your baby begin to show one of their first emotional milestones - stranger anxiety. Even familiar faces can cause tears, but it is common and normal.",
	"Pstw14": "Tummy time helps skills like crawling, reaching, and rolling while strengthening baby's neck, back, arms, and shoulders. It's great to be doing this daily.",
	"Pstw15": "Although your baby won't recognise their own face in the mirror until somewhere between the age of 2 and 3, they will find it fascinating. Give them some noisy toys and rattles while sitting looking in the mirror and they'll be entertained for ages!",
	"Pstw16": "You may think your little one is starting to sprout their first tooth (usually the lower middle) but don't worry if there's still no sign, most babies have their first tooth around six months.",
	"Pstw39": "Your little one is developing every day and reaching new milestones all the time. Take a look at more developments to come.",
	"Pstw40": "Your baby is learning new things everyday including fine motor skills like using their thumb and finger to pick up small objects.",
	"Pstw41": "Babies reach their milestones in their own time, but does when they reach milestones actually reflect how clever they'll be?",
	"Pstw42": "Your baby is learning the difference between people they know and people they don't. Stranger anxiety is a normal stage of development around now.",
	"Pstw43": "Babies' cognitive development including thinking, learning and remembering alongside important physical sensory and motor skills are continually developing.",
	"Pstw44": "Cruising towards their first birthday and possibly cruising around your furniture. Find out what else is coming up in their world.",
	"Pstw45": "Your baby is on their way to learning to say their first words, getting more adventurous and possibly on their way to taking their first steps.",

	"Pstw07": "Your baby is taking in the world around them and they can see a whole lot more than when they were first born. Everything around them is interesting so they might try and reach out and grab your hair and glasses! Try introducing a rattle and watch your baby learn to open and shut their fists to hold it.",
	"Pstw08": "Starting from around 2 months your baby might start making those adorable baby gargling sounds and if you pop them on their tummy, they may try and lift their head and shoulders up a little.",
	"Pstw09": "Your nine week old baby is learning loads of new things every day. Their hearing has been fully developed for a while now but they might now start to be really interested in where music and sounds are coming from by kicking their legs excitedly and listening intently.",
	"Pstw10": "You'll probably start to notice your baby sleeping for longer periods around now - maybe even five or six hours at a time, if you're really lucky. Now's a good time to encourage those neck muscles to strengthen by putting them on their tummies for a bit of tummy time.",
	"Pstw11": "Your baby will respond to you singing nursery rhymes about now, looking at simple picture books, and playing peep-po... and be much more interested in everything else going on around them too.",
	"Pstw12": "Some babies and we emphasis some, might be sleeping through the night by now but don't despair if they're not as all babies get there in their own time.",
	"Pstw13": "Your baby has always known who you are, but by 13 weeks old, they may give you more signs that they recognise you. It can be little things like smiling and kicking when you make eye contact, or answering you with little gurgles and baby talk.",
	"Pstw46": "It's hard to escape other mums excitedly telling you how advanced their little one is and even though we know babies develop at their own pace, it's easy to get caught up in development anxiety.",
	"Pstw47": "Your baby's social development can feel like a little bit like a rollercoaster ride and your baby may sometimes show two different personalities.",
	"Pstw48": "With your baby's first birthday fast approaching you may want to consider a cake smash celebration where your little one is encouraged to smash up their own birthday cake while you take pictures!",
	"Pstw49": "Your baby is likely to be communicating with you in different ways - making noises, pointing and looking to get your attention.",
	"Pstw50": "Your little one has been in the world for nearly a whole year and has achieved so much. Their next round of milestones will soon be even more momentous!",
	"Pstw51": "Even if you're not obsessing about it, most likely you've been asked if baby is walking yet. Babies take their first steps between 9-15 months, but how can you tell if your little one is about to take their first steps?",
	"Pstw52": "It's so exciting to watch your baby's development, but it's easy to worry that they're not walking and talking at the 'right' time.",
	"Pstw38": "There's a good chance that your baby will be getting upright, with the help of furniture and even taking those occasional cruising steps before too long.",
